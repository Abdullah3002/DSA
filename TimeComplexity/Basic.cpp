Time Complexity â‰  Actual Execution Time

Time complexity does not directly represent the actual time taken to run a program on a specific machine.

For example, if you run the same code on an old laptop and a new MacBook, the execution time will differ because of hardware differences (CPU speed, memory, etc.).

However, time complexity measures how the runtime grows with input size (n), independent of hardware. It provides a mathematical way to analyze an algorithm's efficiency based on the number of operations, not absolute time.

So, it's correct to say:
ðŸ‘‰ Time Complexity â‰  Actual Execution Time
ðŸ‘‰ Time Complexity depends on input size, not hardware
